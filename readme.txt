Description:
This Java project simulates a deck of playing cards, allowing you to test and interact with individual cards and decks. The project includes classes for Card and Deck, each demonstrating specific functionalities related to playing cards.

Files:
1. Main.java - This is the main class of the project that contains the entry point for the program. It showcases the usage of the Card and Deck classes by performing various actions such as creating cards, creating a deck, shuffling the deck, and dealing cards.

2. Card.java - This class defines the Card object. It has constructors to create cards with different attributes, such as suit and rank, and provides methods to retrieve card information.

3. Deck.java - This class defines the Deck object. It manages a collection of Card objects, offering methods to initialize the deck, shuffle the cards, deal cards, and perform other operations related to playing cards.

Usage:
1. Compile the Java files:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
   Run the following command to compile the Java files: javac Main.java Card.java Deck.java

2. Run the program:
After compiling the files, run the program using the following command: java Main


3. Observe the Output:
The program will output information about individual cards, shuffling the deck, dealing cards, and more. Pay attention to the console output to see the actions performed by the program.

4. Explore and Modify:
You can explore the Card and Deck classes to understand how the functionalities are implemented. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different card-related operations.
